A simple project to evaluate our middleware and RabbitMQ performance running in a Raspberry. The client simulates a radiaton sensor, that sends radiation readings to middleware. The middelware, as a intermediate agent, relays the information to a receiver and a operator can take a decision, based on shown radiation report. Built using Go language.
